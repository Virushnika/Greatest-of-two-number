# Greatest-of-two-number
ChatGPT said:  This Java program compares two integers entered by the user. It reads two numbers using the Scanner class and checks which is greater. If the first number is larger, it prints that value as greater; if the second is larger, it prints accordingly. If both are the same, it displays “Both are equal.”
